### Introduction to Debugging

Debugging is a crucial skill in programming, allowing developers to identify and fix errors or bugs in their code. Effective debugging ensures that software runs smoothly and meets its intended functionality. This subsection will cover:
- Common types of bugs: syntax errors, runtime errors, logic errors.
- Strategies for identifying bugs early in the development process.
- The importance of testing and code reviews in preventing bugs.

**Code Examples:**

```
int main() { int a = 5; int b = 0; int c = a / b; // runtime error: division by zero }
```

**Quizzes:**

**What type of error occurs if you try to divide a number by zero in most programming languages?**

- Syntax error
- Runtime error
- Logic error

**Answer:** Runtime error

### Using Debugging Tools

Debugging tools are essential for efficiently locating and fixing bugs. This subsection will explore:
- Built-in debugger tools in popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA.
- Setting breakpoints and stepping through code.
- Monitoring variable values and call stacks in real time.
- Using print statements for simple debugging.

**Code Examples:**

```
// Example using a breakpoint
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
console.log(a + b); // Set breakpoint here and watch variables
```

**Quizzes:**

**Which IDE feature allows you to pause program execution to inspect the state of your application?**

- Formatter
- Breakpoint
- Compiler

**Answer:** Breakpoint

### Coding Best Practices

Adhering to coding best practices enhances code readability, maintainability, and performance. This subsection will include:
- Writing clean and understandable code using comments and consistent naming conventions.
- The DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- Code modularization through functions and classes.
- Importance of conducting code reviews and receiving feedback.

**Video URL:** http://video.com/codingBestPractices

**Code Examples:**

```
// Bad practice
a = 10;
b = 20;
result = a + b;

// Good practice
let startValue = 10;
let incrementValue = 20;
let totalValue = startValue + incrementValue;
```
