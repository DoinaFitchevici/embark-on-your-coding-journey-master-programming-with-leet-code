### Understanding Variables

Variables are fundamental to programming as they allow us to store data that can be manipulated by the program. They can be thought of as containers for storing data values.

**Which of the following is a string data type?**

- 123
- 'hello world'
- true
- undefined

**Answer:** 'hello world'

### Control Structures in Programming

Control structures manage the flow of a program. They include conditional statements and loops that dictate the execution path based on conditions and repetitions.

**Code Examples:**

```
if (x > 10) { console.log('X is greater than 10'); }
```

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); }
```

**Quizzes:**

**Which statement is used to repeat actions in programming?**

- if statement
- for loop
- switch case

**Answer:** for loop

### Functions and Their Uses

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help to make code modular, easier to understand, and debug.
