# Assignment 2: Implement Basic Data Structures

## Objective

Develop proficiency in creating and using arrays and linked lists.

## Expected Capabilities

- Initialize and manipulate arrays
- Create simple linked list structures

## Instructions

### Part 1

**Create and Manipulate Arrays**

Initialize an array and perform various operations such as adding, updating, and removing elements.

```
int[] numbers = {1, 2}; numbers[0] = 3;
```

### Part 2

**Implement a Simple Linked List**

Create a basic linked list and perform insertions and deletions.

```
class LinkedList { Node head; void insert(int data) { /* Code here */ } }
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Array Operations

Perform operations such as accessing and modifying array elements.

```
int[] nums = {1,2}; nums[1] = 4;
```

### Task 2: Basic Linked List

Create a simple linked list structure.

```
class Node { int data; Node next; Node(int d) { data = d; } }
```
