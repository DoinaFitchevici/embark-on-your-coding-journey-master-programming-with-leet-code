# Assignment 5: Implement Debugging Processes and Best Practices

## Objective

Ensure all students can identify and correct errors in their code using debugging tools and best practices.

## Expected Capabilities

- Use debugging tools effectively
- Implement coding best practices
- Identify and fix code errors

## Instructions

### Part 1

**Install a Debugger Tool**

Ensure you have a debugging tool setup, like the debugger in Visual Studio Code.

```
N/A
```

**Debug a Simple Program**

Use a debugger to step through a program with intentional errors and resolve them.

```
function add(a, b) {
  // Intentional error: should be 'return a + b'
  return a - b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Debug this to find the error

```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Review and Refactor Code

Refactor a provided code snippet by applying coding best practices.

```
N/A
```

## Submission Instructions

Submit a document explaining the debugging process and before/after code comparison for refactoring.
